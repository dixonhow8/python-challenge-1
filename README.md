# **Python Assignment 1: Bridget's Variety Food Truck**

## Description
This Python script simulates a food ordering system for Bridget's Variety Food Truck. Customers can select items from various categories such as snacks, meals, drinks, and desserts. They can then specify the quantity for each item and place their order. The script calculates the total cost of the order and displays it in a receipt format.

## Menu Dictionary
The script uses a dictionary named `sub_menu` to store the menu items and their prices. The menu is structured into different categories such as snacks, meals, drinks, and desserts. Each category contains a list of items along with their respective prices.

## Script Structure
The script is structured into the following main components:
- **Menu Definition:** The `sub_menu` dictionary contains the menu items and their prices.
- **Ordering Process:** The main loop of the script allows customers to select items, specify quantities, and complete their order.
- **Print Functions:** The `print_menu` function is responsible for displaying the menu to the customer, and the script also includes functions to print the customer's order and total cost.
